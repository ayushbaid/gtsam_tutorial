# Introduction

I have compiled a small tutorial based on how I learnt GTSAM. I hope this can be useful to others too. GTSAM

# Installation

Follow the GTSAM's installation path setting `GTSAM_INSTALL_CYTHON_TOOLBOX=ON` in the cmake command.

When installing from the the cython directory, do make sure to use the correct python interpreter. For e.g. I used `/home/ayush/miniconda3/bin/python setup.py install` command. Just using python was using the system wide interpreter instead of anaconda's.
